Just a run-down of what each one does:

<ul class="filter-list">
  <li><span>Breeze:</span> Breeze will fade out darker colours (like black, dark browns), and wash your photo with blue tones. This results in a faded, cooling effect.</li>
  <li><span>Golden Hour:</span> This will increase contrast and invite red, orange, and yellow hues into your photo. I use this often to mimic a golden hour effect.</li>
  <li><span>Greenery:</span> Greenery will take out darker colours and fill them in with greens. I normally don't use this by itself as the greens become a little overpowering. I try and use it with a washed out setting like Breeze or Raging Mist.</li>
  <li><span>Old Hue:</span> I love this one and I use it a bit too often. This tones downs highlights with hues of faded yellow and purple.</li>
  <li><span>Purple Haze:</span> This is a fun one. It's pretty self explanatory but it hits the entire photo down with purple and violet hues.</li>
  <li><span>Mother Nature:</span> It's kind of a cross between Breeze and Greenery. Again you get darker colours washed out but there are small hits of green along with the blue.</li>
  <li><span>Safari:</span> This brings out a lot of yellow warm tones. I like using it in photos with a lot of purple or pink variations because it makes those colours soft, but vibrant.</li>
  <li><span>Sky:</span> This is more or less a conteractive to Safari. Instead of a yellow contrast, we get a blue one. Images will tend to look crisp, cool, yet while still maintaining natural vibrancy.</li>
  <li><span>Raging Mist:</span> Raging Mist offers the most faded out look of all these. It fades out images with purple hues and warmer tones to create a sultry vintage effect.</li>
  <li><span>Warm Embrance</span>: Warm Embrace gives your photos an intense red warmth. Often times it's a bit too strong so I use it in conjunction with a cool setting like Sky, or Breeze.</li>
  <li><span>Warm Kiss:</span> Much like Safari, Warm Kiss will increase warmer hues, but it'll also wash out darker tones.</li>
  <li><span>Underwater:</span> This will really run your image over with hues of blue and green. Again another heavy filter that I often use in conjunction with something else (usually Safari).</li>
